---------------------------------

1. Use cases

1.1 Site registration
* generate random email (the random part is later called 'tag')
** e.g. B07TVG9964@dsacks.cc
* all the communication to that email is forwarded to user's email
* user is able to send email from that random address
* tag is associated with the site where it was used
** if, for example, user gets spam or promotions addressed to that tag, she can identify the source
* User's own email is never disclosed

1.2 Drop messages
* a generated tag can be accessed online, e.g. http://dsacks.cc/B07TVG9964
** each tag will have a permission, whether it's visible to public
** tag can contain a user-defined message
* other users can send and receive messages on that tag
